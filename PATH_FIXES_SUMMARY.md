# LeaveTracker Path Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the path-related fixes applied to the LeaveTracker project to resolve navigation, include, and asset loading issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Inconsistent Relative Paths
- **Problem**: Files in different directories used inconsistent relative paths (some used `../`, others didn't)
- **Solution**: Implemented dynamic path calculation based on current script location

### 2. Duplicate Path Segments
- **Problem**: Multiple path segments were duplicated (e.g., `/modules/modules/modules/`)
- **Solution**: Cleaned up all duplicate segments using regex patterns

### 3. Hardcoded Absolute Paths
- **Problem**: Some files contained hardcoded Windows paths (`C:\xampp\htdocs\LeaveTracker\`)
- **Solution**: Replaced with relative paths and dynamic path calculation

### 4. Navigation Links
- **Problem**: Navigation links in header.php didn't work from all directory levels
- **Solution**: Implemented dynamic `$basePath` variable for all navigation links

### 5. Asset Loading (CSS/JS/Images)
- **Problem**: CSS, JavaScript, and image files couldn't load from subdirectories
- **Solution**: Used dynamic path calculation for all asset references

### 6. Include/Require Statements
- **Problem**: PHP includes failed when called from different directory levels
- **Solution**: Standardized all includes to use proper relative paths

### 7. Form Actions and Redirects
- **Problem**: Form submissions and header redirects used incorrect paths
- **Solution**: Fixed all form actions and redirects to use appropriate relative paths

## Files Modified

### Core Files
- `includes/header.php` - Complete rewrite with dynamic navigation
- `includes/footer.php` - Fixed asset paths and AJAX URLs
- `config/db.php` - No changes needed (already correct)

### Dashboard Files
- `dashboards/staff_dashboard.php`
- `dashboards/department_head_dashboard.php`
- `dashboards/dean_dashboard.php`
- `dashboards/principal_dashboard.php`
- `dashboards/hr_admin_dashboard.php`

### Module Files
- All files in `modules/` directory (25+ files)
- Fixed includes, redirects, and form actions

### Admin Files
- All files in `admin/` directory (6 files)
- Fixed navigation and form submissions

### Other Files
- `index.php` - Fixed dashboard includes
- `login.php` - Fixed redirects and asset paths
- `reports/leave_report.php` - Fixed includes and navigation

## Scripts Created

### 1. `fix_paths_comprehensive.php`
- Main script that analyzed and fixed path issues across all files
- Processed 51 PHP files and modified 43 of them

### 2. `fix_specific_paths.php`
- Targeted specific common path patterns
- Fixed remaining issues after comprehensive fix

### 3. `final_path_cleanup.php`
- Cleaned up duplicate path segments
- Removed hardcoded absolute paths
- Final verification and cleanup

### 4. `includes/path_helper.php`
- Utility functions for consistent path handling
- Helper functions for future development

### 5. `test_paths.php`
- Test script to verify all paths work correctly
- Confirms database, includes, and assets are accessible

## Dynamic Path Solution

The main solution implemented uses PHP to calculate the correct relative path based on the current script location:

```php
<?php
$currentScript = $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'];
$currentDir = dirname($currentScript);
$levels = substr_count(trim($currentDir, '/'), '/');
$basePath = str_repeat('../', $levels);
?>
```

This `$basePath` variable is then used throughout the application:
- Navigation links: `href="<?php echo $basePath; ?>modules/apply_leave.php"`
- Asset loading: `src="<?php echo $basePath; ?>css/style.css"`
- Form actions: `action="<?php echo $basePath; ?>modules/process.php"`

## Verification

All fixes have been tested and verified:
- ✅ Database connections work from all directories
- ✅ Header and footer includes load correctly
- ✅ CSS and JavaScript files load properly
- ✅ Navigation links work from any page
- ✅ Form submissions and redirects function correctly

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Navigation**: All navigation links work regardless of current page location
2. **Proper Asset Loading**: CSS, JS, and images load correctly from any directory
3. **Reliable Includes**: PHP includes work consistently across all files
4. **Maintainable Code**: Dynamic path calculation makes the code more maintainable
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Paths work on both Windows and Unix-like systems

## Future Maintenance

To maintain proper paths in future development:

1. Always use the `$basePath` variable for navigation and assets
2. Use the helper functions in `includes/path_helper.php`
3. Test new pages from different directory levels
4. Run `test_paths.php` after making changes to verify paths still work
